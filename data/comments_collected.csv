0,"We're all affected in different ways. The length of time, severity and  heritage can play a part just like Covid. 
It's been a whole week now and the  lack of sleep , coughing fits, intermittent  temperature, phlegm, slight shortness of breath, runny nose, sneezing, fatigue has floored me.

I work in a large school with young children. 15  intermittent cases of staff Covid during the past few weeks says alot . A chorus of coughing in the classroom, despite my restless handwashing layered with good alcohol sanitizer  good diet, excellent diet IN FACT with Vit C and Zinc  supplements hasnt overly  protected me . 

As an older woman I've never had  this Virus so bad . The coughing is the worst when it comes in fits 😫. 

I feel I'm turning a corner now, having been off work  for almost a week now!... 

Make no bones about it, I don't bounce back like when I was younger, so now I just do what I can to help my body heal.

I do suffer with ear nose and throat issues whenever I contract a virus 🙃...could be a lot worse...All will be well. Xxx"
1,"No correlation between color of mucus and bacterial infection.  Almost ALWAS due to bronchospasm.  First line drug:  Albuterol.  Second/Third/Fourth line drug:  ALbuterol.   Then a floroquinolone.  If the cough lasts more than 2 weeks, think about adult pertussis."
2,Somebody in here who has been dealing with Bronchitis and has get rid of the cough completely?
3,Bronchitis after covid. 11days terrible shortness of breathe. Inhaler doing nothing. Going for antibiotics today. Trying benelyn mucous phlegm syrup.
4,Definitely have a lot of these. But vomiting. Not a constant cough. I do have some wheezing. I think I have this more then I do COVID. But I'm not doctor and most symptoms are same on a lot of these Viruses. But I was around my neighbor who had had it.
5,"Funnily enough, after having a sore throat, cough, tonsillitis secondary to a cold, I recovered after having some antibiotics.. or so I thought. Only had a week's reprieve then developed a severe, persistent deep cough which was more chesty the 2nd time around. One episode of my coughing fits was so bad I vomited. The phlegm I produced went from green to yellow. It only lasted 7-8 days but felt like forever, tired all-round, low-grade fever. Very difficult getting a GP appt in the NHS but I definitely had a feeling it was bronchitis because I've never had a cough as bad as that, it was very stubborn. Also, I'm that person that just wants to crack on with things, so felt I can just ride it out. My coughs are usually bad and make people around me concerned but I always got over them and it's always the 1st symptom to go away when I'm recovering from my cold. The ?bronchitis went after 7-8 days then I had a further 10days-2weeks reprieve then just 2 days go developed a new sudden onset cough. It's back with a vengeance :') and it's dry and hacking so far, just using my usual remedies and OTC meds. Le sigh"
6,"Bronchitis in Ayurveda is correlated with kasa roga. In this disease, there is aggravation of vata and kapha dosha. Due to which cough, cold, excessive mucus production, breathlessness, chest congestion, & chest tightness take place. In bronchitis, there is formation of ama in the lungs."
7,Any one have chest pains when breathing
8,"Imagine having this round the time of covid. Almost the same symptoms, coughing & shortness of breath"
9,Now i have been sick for 17 year's with my severe asthma and COPD.I am 53 now but keep my self active take my vitamins everyday suppose to use 2 to 3 liters of o2 24/7 but are times i dont need it..This coming in from 2019/2020 i have had severe bronchitis and COPD exhauberations alot this year due to the weather.Right now i am getting a flare up and with thid COVID-19 its almost the same conditions and symptoms.I have no fever but kinda hard to get the doctor to let me come in cause of that virus but how do you really tell the differences between the two when you indeed can have all the same issues?and what do i do?I have wheezing that was breaking up but more of a dry cough right now and stuffy nose and sinuses..
10,"I have had it twice in the past 4 months, both after have a cold, sore throat and fever. Both times I had a hacking cough for 4 weeks afterwards! Really scratchy and painful, I have to cough otherwise it starts to burn."
11,"Not bragging but I had them all. Just got over C.O.V.I.D. three or four days before getting this I carried a headache and chest pain. Than one night I laid under two throws, to heavy quilts, blanket and bed spread and chilled 4 hours. The next day I was congested and could not clear my sinuses. Also my fever spiked and fell down very quickly. I went to my doctor they tested me, and it was positive. I felt like I'd been hit by an 18 wheeler.  R.S.V. I was tested for last year and it is extremely bad on the lungs especially the lower lobes. In my area the only medicine that was given to me was steroids and the pills to soothe coughing they are called pearls. Usually R.S.V. runs two weeks. Very hard to cough the mucus from lungs it goes away on it's own. Treatment might be different for babies and elderly.  Influenza different types. Viral. One type gives you a sore throat, body aches and another gives you nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea with this especially you have to watch your potassium levels. Low levels can cause heart issues and severe muscle cramps.  Any illness that causes electrolyte imbalance creates this issue. Most important advice. Get the flu shot and keep your pneumonia shots up to date  because most of these illnesses can turn to pneumonia. C.O.V.I.D. vaccines questionable. You have to do what's right for you. C.O.V.I.D. is far worse than a common cold."
12,"I am slowly getting over RSV and I can tell you that I have never been so sick in my life. As someone who is immune compromised, this RSV has hurt me tremendously. Shortness of breath and wheezing have been a common element with RSV for me and the overall fatigue level is bad. I do not wish this on anyone"
13,"Lemme tell you, RSV is no joke for older people! I got it from a relative who works at a school and caught what we though was a cold. RSV sent me to urgent care, who tested for covid and RSV and they sent me to the ER due to my breathing troubles. I did not have a fever. I'm vaccinated against covid and flu and stay away from crowds because of ovarian cancer surgery and chemo in 2022."
14,"Saturday, my husband, who had been coughing his guts out for 3 weeks, two days before Christmas, had enough and went to the Dr.   They did a few swabs.  I had Delta two and 1/2 years ago, was hospitalized, then long Covid, lost all my hair, etc.  My son caught it from me, but he never did.  We couldn't believe.  Be tested for 6 weeks. 
With his bad cough, not once did any of us suspect he had covid.  His swab for Covid showed a weak positive, the Dr told him, which meant, he was at the end of it or the start of it.  We were floored.  Sunday, I took a home Covid test not feeling sick at all, but feared I could have now symptoms and be a carrier.  Negative.  My husband took a home test.  Negative.  Tuesday, he went back to Dr, and dropped another positive.  This time, they did not say, it was a ""weak"" one; and, the prior Dr, who had seen him wrote, ""positive."" 
The only symptom, he had, was a cough.  
Now, its starting on me.  Yesterday, my head was stopped up tight as a drum, and this morning my throat was sore. 

Here's my question:  Are clots still a concern for Covid patient's?"
15,"I got rsv, dude let me tell you, i have never felt this sick before,  i didn't get a fever, i had it about 2 weeks, finally over it, still have a slight dry cough but im good. I was so weak i couldn't do anything, light headed, i was coughing up clear mucas for like a week straight, it was absolutely the most annoying sickness I've ever had, I took Mucinex extra strength and it definitely helped!  But it was torture, took lot of vitamins etc it seems like 2 weeks is when the rsv virus dissipates, about that time line"
16,"I recently got Brain Fog still have it, Fatigue, leg tingling, and chills."
17,I had the flu recently and had a high fever lasted 3 days it was pretty bad the first day but really not much symptoms besides the fever and severe weakness
18,"I'm pretty sure I caught a cold.  I started out with a sore throat that lasted only 24-48 hours.  Next day I was feeling congested, but was clearing out very fast.  By day 3 I had a wet cough (I was coughing out mucus at a rapid rate despite being congested).  By day 5 I got hit with a gnarly headache that went away overnight and now my congestion is mostly clear."
19,I only have sinus bad cough and phlegm and I feel a whistle when I breathe I can't smell anything after 3 weeks of feeling bad. I didn't get any fever i caugh a lot
20,"Currently on day 7 of what I think is a bad cold.  Home covid test was negative. When I actually had covid in 2021 it was so mild, it was like mild hay fever symptoms! A little sneezing and runny nose but no coughing or fatigue. Never lost smell or taste.  Symptom-wise, I would take covid over this freakin cold  any day!"
21,"I’m still dealing with RSV 7 days in. Misery. Fever, sore throat, chest pain and so much productive phlegm.  The first 2 hours in the a.m. are a misery with coughing up gunk until I vomit.  The coughing is miserable. Tested negative for influenza and covid."
22,"Me and my family all caught covid from the same source in Sept. ‘23, and for ALL of us, our symptoms were not as described in this video.  We all came down with symptoms within 24-30 hrs of exposure, and started with mild sore throat that slowly worsened over the first 24 hrs to feel like we were swallowing glass w/gradually worsening throat congestion, fevers of 100-103F with extreme fatigue and aches.  The dry cough is the only symptom that matches the description in this video.  Just sharing in case it helps."
23,"It’s hard to figure out what I had. It started with watery eyes,runny nose and sore throat. This was gradual,then came a dry cough. Woke up in the middle of the night wheezing. Even after a month I still haven’t got my taste and smell back. The doctor figured I had a throat infection put me on antibiotics and prednisone because my throat was swelling. I do know there was a lot of influenza A going around at the time. So who knows?"
24,"Just avoid all this confusion and take a 4-1 antigen test that tests for Influenza A and B, Covid-19 and RSV."
25,"Hi Doc, I just had quad test at my doctors office and had RSV. Now I’m a 44 male and let me tell you I have NEVER felt sicker than I do now! This RSV IS NASTY! Fever, wheezing, cough and short of breath plus EXTREME body aches… why do you suspect it is this bad? ( I know that’s probably hard to answer)"
26,"I'm almost recovered from what the doctor said is a viral infection, that started on Nov. 16. I baby-sat my 3 year old great nephew (who started daycare in Sept) on a Monday. By Thursday I had a runny nose and eyes, sore throat and cough. On Friday I had vomiting and 102 fever, aches, chills, loss of appetite and fatigue. Head and chest congestion but mucus stayed clear throughout the entire three weeks , and no chest pain. At the doctor's on Monday I had no fever and tested negative for Covid, strep, and flu. Monday night my fever was 101.8 and I had laryngitis. I was in bed for 7 days and lost 12 lbs in two weeks. My recovery has been slow but I'm better, have gained back two pounds and can be more active now, although my energy is still low. I'm 66, and this is the worst cold virus I've ever had.
 I had a flu shot and two Shingles shots this year. I'm getting the shots for Covid, RSV and pneumonia as soon as I'm healthy again- hopefully before it's too late."
27,"Rsv is no joke. Its worse  then covid today, alot of coughing, mucus , no sleep !! Because your constantly walking up to coughing mucus."
28,I am giving up junk food 🥘 completely so I don’t get sick 😷. I just got sick 🤒 48 hours ago and still going to work as a cashier but I do have shortness of breath.
29,"Me having crippling anxiety about diarrhea and/or vomiting (I am experiencing anxiety and OCD), these viruses will be an issue for me."
30,"So the last time I tested positive for flu, I had zero fever but felt bad. Right now, I have all the same symptoms and symptom checker said flu though I have no fever, but EVERY video says flu involves fever. Is my immune response impaired, or sometimes there's just no fever?"
31,"I do believe I had RSV. I had this many years ago that took 6 weeks to get over.
  This time around was a little different. The 1st week was feeling tired and run down with tempter spikes. You could see on my arm when my temperature went up, so I increased my water. 2nd week it felt like I had a ton of bricks sitting on my chest and had a dry cough. On the 2nd day of the 2nd week, I had to go home from work from an upset stomach. Slept for 6 hrs got to get something to eat then slept for 10hrs till the next morning.  Felt great the next day, though still had the heaviness in my chest. Only having a slightly runny nose.  That Wednesday I notice that I was Losing my sense of smell and taste. By the Friday of the 2nd week after work it hit like a truck ran over my body. Everything hurt. By Saturday I couldn't stop sneezing and coughing and body aches all over. Slept most of the weekend away. The 3rd week Monday the body aches were gone felt better tough still tried. The only thing that is left is the draining. My taste and smell are coming back slowly. 
  I do believe having Asthma made it worse having a ton of bricks sitting on my chest and having to fight for breath was exhausting and being older didn't help. I never got a sore throat. 
  I did test for Covid negative, though I was told that I was A- symptomatic at the beginning of Covid."
32,Constantly sneezing like insane runny nose and hardly any cough man no fever... Just sleepless nights with these fricken sneezes. That is literally my only symptoms. Insanely runny nose and i cant stop sneezing. For days now. Days now.
33,"I’m coughing for no reason , no pain nothing just coughing for past 5 weeks"
34,"Night sweats, fatigue,shivers here on day 2. 🥲"
35,That’s exactly what happened with me. I thought something was wrong because of my night sweats (as I was told it’s not a symptom of Covid). I got a PCR Covid test (expecting it to be negative) but the Omicron varian of COVID-19 was detected lol
36,"Welp. Here I am, 3 yrs after it started and it finally got me. Should have never gone into the Dr's office.  100% certain that's where I got because I don't go anywhere. 
For me, the worst has been the headaches.  Then the soreness in my chest and stomach from coughing. Fever and chills with the sweats at night are pretty bad. Can someone come over and give me some monoclonal antibodies? I'm so sick of being sick."
37,"I just got it gor the first time. I have no idea what variants i have. Started with mild throat and sinus irritation and then it hor me like a ramming truck. 

Mild fever, i was out of it and wrecked with uncontrollable chills, fast heart rithm, fast and shallow breathing because of it , although thankfully, no low oxigen. 

I used a space heater and managed to up my temperature to the point where my body and immune system allowed me to sweat. 

That made it better for a bit. 

I asked for paxlovid because if that was the first 24 hours, the following 48 would land me in a hospital bed

Paxlovid did help. Within 14 hours my heart rate dropped to the low 80s, chills were almost gone and i was more awaren."
38,Tested positive Thursday and I am SO hungry. Had a headache and fever the first day but now it’s just being tired and hungry af. Some chills.
39,"Sooo my first time getting this shit, it started with a head ache, sore throat, lower back pain, stiff neck, and chills that were constant. Most sore I've ever felt for no reason. I haven't and won't take the vaccine no matter what. But this shit sucks and is real. I really thought it was horse shit but I got it now and wish it would just go away already. Sitting on my patio soaking up sun in the hopes I get some natural vitamin d along with taking multi vitamins and kick ass 800mg single tabs from Mexico are helping bare with the pain. Probably going to door dash some Tylenol too and Advil pm so I can sleep don't wish this shit on anyone"
40,"Day 1-2 mild sore throat with muscle pains
Day 2-3 fever at night with chills
Day 3-4 chills and really bad lower back pain
Still ongoing today
Thank god no cough and I can still smell. Losing my smell is what keeps me on edge I’m scared… 
Eating consists of 60-70% smells over the actual taste. Imagine not even enjoying eating food anymore…"
41,Just a bad fever put the blanket on start sweating instantly..take the blanket of I'm freezing
42,"Ok I have a question. I tested positive and all I had was cold symptoms. No fever, sweats, zero. Is it possible that the rapid tests pick up the original coronavirus, a cold? Which would be why so many have mild symptoms"
43,"Most annoying symptom: the sweats which I get all day long.
Strangest symptom: extremely blurry vision.
Persistent symptom: extreme fatigue
Scariest symptom: heartbeat over 100bpm while at rest."
44,My symptoms started with a bad headache that got worse and worse over the day then had a terrible night of fevers sweats and a pounding headache. Then I woke up and was alright most of the day thanks to Tylenol/Ibuprofen but then that was yesterday and I just woke up and it feels like I throat fucked a curling iron. Wish me luck😷
45,Night sweats are common when your fever is breaking. Happens to me every time I get sick.
46,My whites of my eyes were solid red throat sore laryngitis body aches fatigue tested negative I believe I have omicron now
47,"Inability to feel hunger, lungs feel like I am breathing super cold air. I had covid 3 times now. All severe. I'm sure #3 was omicron"
48,"I had covid in June, first had a scratchy throat, then the worst ever chills. Even under a thick duvet i was shivering. Took me nearly 2 weeks to recover, although i got tired easily for a couple of months"
49,"I have fever and sweating at night.
Little coughs, my body is fighting like a lion.

I feed my lion broccoli fish eggs and  thee with lemon. After two days i feel much better."
50,"Omicron for me:
4 days ago (1st day of symptoms)
Coughed allday felt weak but not too bad night was rather freezing like you know you are about to get feever
2nd day down and 0 energy allday extreme sweating whilst sleeping began 3rd day feeling slightly different as the day before loss of smell and taste 4th day slight. Relief of symptoms although the coughing and overall low energy was still present 
But of all the symptoms the sweating is actually the most severe: felt like sweating 1liter per 3 hours of sleep and believe me you will wake up freezing"
51,"I have the BA5 since yesterday. My lungs hurt a lot, massive body aches, very painful sore throat, no energy, dry cough with phlegm, irritable eyesight, fever and pain in my lungs when coughing. I am in bed since yesterday.
I am 49 years old, took the first 2 main Pzifer vaccines and none of the boosters. I haven’t take the flu shot for over 10 years because I used to get a worse flu with the shot. This is my first time in 10 years that I get a virus that put me in bed. Meaning this new BA5 variant is very strong and painful, more similar to Delta or H1N1 flu who I had 12 years ago. I knew I will get covid one day but I wish for a less painful variant."
52,"Good vid...but I had Covid that cleared up, felt good for couple weeks...then I all of a sudden had pink eye, then sore throat and post nasal drip with dry mouth and pounding headache?...is this typical and how long does it hang around for?"
53,Some people still have unexplainable shortness of breath and lung tightness. The media doesn’t talk about this but mild shortness of breath is the common reason why people come to the ER.
54,Diarrhea! Vomitinng ! No energy. Massive Fevers !
55,"My symptoms with Omicron started 
Monday July 25 ( itchy throat that make me cough a lot during the day, evening i started with headache, i did get tested and came negative.
Tuesday July 26 ( woke up with congested chest “like lots of phlegms” I assume that is was the AC, more headache and some fatigue, came back from work and got tested again because at evening i got more fatigue, the results came positive “by the way i did notify everyone who i was around for the las two days”.
Wednesday July 27 ( i isolated my self in my room and the symptoms were: headache through all the day, congestion in chest and nose, super sleepy, fever and fatigue, i did took medicine help through the day!)
Thursday July 28 ( woke up at 4 am coughing phlegms like crazy for about 2 hours, fever and headache was gone, still nasal congestion and lost about 90% of my smell and like 80% of taste, so went to a clinic because i need it a paper for my work and I noticed that in the clinic i was sweeting a lot “i was in the clinic for like 20-25 min and about 25% of my shirt was cover in sweet” i think is a new symptom that they haven’t talk about too much, i drove around the freeway just to relax and get some sunlight and the sweet continue,)
I will keep posting tomorrow for the remaining symptoms."
56,"Mine began with a sore throat that came on instantly. I had all symptoms of a sinus infection, and was even given antibiotics for it. I tested negative 4 times before I got a positive result day 6. As a chronic migraine sufferer, what I am left with in my brain now is nothing but pain. My eyes have changed. Everything in my face aches. I’m a week Covid free,and worse than I was during."
57,"Not sure which variant I have, but my home test came back positive. It started with dry scratchy cough for couple days then body chills and tiredness. I had it for only one full day, slight headache, body chills, tiredness, cold sweat. I would be in an ac room and sweating profusely like I was in a hot room. Next day I was better and now just have wet cough from sinus drainage . Not vaccinated. What I did was drink a mixture of garlic, ginger, pineapple juice and took vitamins zinc, d3, elderberry. Do NOT Drink Milk while sick. It will cause mucus to build up on your chest."
58,"Damn :( I feel weak, head hurts , fatigue , cold chills and hard for me to walk long distance, calf’s start hurting like I just had a workout :/ been like this for 3 days  and I have no vaccine so it’s hitting hard (not sure if it’s Covid)"
59,24 hour chills headache allergies symtoms
60,"My starting symptoms was extreme lethargy and lack of attention. Then an unproductive cough, headache, sweating, weird dreams and intense eye discomfort. The initial symptoms popped up three days prior to the more severe ones. Also had a Low grade fever, no body aches. I am at day 6 and slight upper respiratory discomfort, I tested negative today."
61,have it now going through the sweats nose burning fever headache but its in my LUNGS?
62,Started horrendous headache..then sweating..horrific sore throat..burning nose..fatique..loss of taste and smell..
63,"I'm on my 5 days and I feel bad. Headache, dizziness, brain fog, I can't focus or even think."
64,"Idk what version I have but I have a fever 101, it’s day 3 no cough, kinda stuffy nose, I just wanna be better already 😔"
65,I'm wondering if I'm getting covid. I have scratchy throat. Feels a tightening in my throat and chest. Felt like my chest was being sat on. A cough here and there. Now I have chills and some body aches no fever. I've also been having discomfort under my left rib for weeks now so idk if it's related to that. It's on the side and radiates to the side. Sometimes  I feel it in my left arm or neck. Idk anymore 😕
66,"Mine started with a weird pressure in my upper chest, and it oddly kept waking me up all night. I thought that’s weird I don’t feel sick or tired why is this weird sensation waking me up!? The next day I lost my voice but had no fever and full energy so I did assume it was allergies, I took a test and it was negative. But the chest congestion was off the hook and my cousin said I looked grey. By the next morning my chest was inflamed, sweating, achy and I tested positive. The body aches were off the charts. The fever wouldn’t break, then the headache. I can feel the vaccine doing it’s job though as I’m immunocompromised and I am able to fight through this. I am in plaxovid anti viral and I think it’s making me feel worse than the actual virus at this point. Two more day of quarantine and off this meds then we’ll see I guess. The dreams have been crazy. This is the weirdest illness I’ve ever had and it’s like nothing I’ve ever felt before."
67,I've got it now and I'm not vaccinated I've had the sore throat making me cough at night thats the worst part is lack of sleep because of the coughing. My nose has been clogged the entire time but fixed with nasal spray. I'm going on a week and I'm still not over it. No fever very quick not to bad headaches every couple days but so far it's been like the flu or strep throat for me.
68,"I had night sweats, back of the neck pain, shoulder pain. I still have the neck/pain - it is bad. 
Loss of taste & smell.  Cold plus weird soar throat. Exhausted.  Low fever. Congestion and a compulsion to drink water constantly."
69,"Tested positive yesterday, so far fever has reached a max of 101.  Runny nose, occasional cough, and night sweats. I'm 37, male, and take high blood pressure medicine"
70,"Ok heres my symptoms 65 yo male, started with fatigue sore throat extreme joint pain even jolts of electricity, fingers hurt and felt like they were burning, toes hurt, elbows, hips, knees, loss of sleep, tried sleeping pills and worked sometimes , sore throat my voice changed to a baritone, vision change, loss of appetite but I did eat, i have no energy even tried to do yard work to no avail. neck is sore and my lower back is killing me, dizzy have to be careful not to fall, had to urinate every hour on the hour., constipation rather than diarrhea. And in general I just have a bad attitude and am mean to my loved ones but not my cats. My cats seem to change my whole outlook on life and when they lay on me Gretta, Ling Ling or just kissing them makes me feel good. I feel the presence of God when my cats are around, I lost three this year, Cora, Crybaby and my beautiful Rose petal and I am heartbroken..  Good luck to all and God Bless our Beautiful America. Get Well."
71,I had sneezing and fever. And bad sore throat.  I'm over it
72,"I have omicron and seem to be waking up with a hot face and body-no sweats and no fever. Otherwise scratchy throat, brain fog, and and cough"
73,"I’ve got the flu right now and it’s the worst flu I’ve ever had. Last night I had a fever of 105F and tonight it’s around 102F. This case of the flu makes me feel like I’m going to die with constant headaches, body aches, coughing, and not being able to sleep. I hope that nobody else has to get this same type of flu because this is just awful."
74,"I'm on day 5 of the worst flu that I've ever had. I was in Vegas last week for a conference. Went with around 25 people from work and so far, I'm the only one who's sick 🙄. Fever, chills, sore throat, headache, body aches, sensitive skin, and coughing. Best of luck to all of you out there battling this virus."
75,If you have the flu get some  broth and it can be combined  together with onions and garlic and parsley basil and oregano with hamburger meat  and use ginger to fight  nausea and vomiting and get to your doctor as soon as possible so that they can prescribe the proper treatment for your flu cold or pneumonia whichever one you're a sick with currently I got my flu and pneumonia shot hopefully if I get it it won't be as bad as it would have been without it
76,My body aches 😭😭😭😭
77,I would like to see if I had anything in my medicine cabinet for nausea cuz I have the flu what Dramamine help with nausea and vomiting
78,What's the best thing you can get for nausea please respond ASAP I have the flu no way of going anywhere
79,Why not paracetamol it reduce the fever?
80,have type B flu right now and this is been the longest worse week of my life yall pray for me current day 6 aches and headache seem to have passed but still am nauseous
81,"Planet Ayurveda, your body aches medicine is a treasure. It's like a secret weapon against pain that I can't keep to myself."
82,"Went to the e.r. last night, I can say with confidence this is the worst I've ever felt. ( I've been through 2 broken arms and liver failure) the headache was the worst, I literally could not move my head and I passed out because of how dizzy I was and my low iron didn't help. Omg. Pray for me y'all 😭"
83,"Around this time of year is usually when I get sick. Last year it took me OUT. I was sick as a dog and couldn't eat for almost 3 days. I had a fever, body aches, you name it. My roommate got me Coricidin, which is a pretty hardcore cough medicine. I dont recommend taking it if you have high blood pressure. I took it one night, hoping that it would work and lets just say it did. It made my fever spike as I woke up at 3 am drenched in sweat. My fever must have gotten pretty high because it went through my shirt and my bedsheets. Would I take Coricidin again? Probably not as it made my fever sky high."
84,I woke up with the worst headache of my life today 💀
85,I’m so coldddddd ugh. These chills got my teeth sounding like drumsticks😅
86,"As someone who has a history of migraines, a flu headache was perhaps the most intense headache I've ever had. Thank God that is over. God bless those who are still struggling 😊"
87,sleeping is not easy when you cant breathe...
88,I have shakes and chills
89,I get sick at least 3 to 4 times a year. Coughs and colds and flu sometimes 2x during winter . There's nothing I can do I'm so used to it. But I find sweating it out works best on the day the flu is at its peak [ the day you feel you have to stay in bed and nothing else ]

102,"At A&E two nights ago when my mum had palpitations for 30 mins. She’d now admitted and they’re still doing checks. 
A few months ago she saw the GP with recurrent nausea to the point an otherwise busy woman wouldn’t leave her chair let alone home for around two weeks. Not once was this nausea questioned as having any links to a possible heart attack. 
It’s now looking very much like that’s what it was. Or at least it was a missed warning. 
In the UK."

105,"I have had all those symptoms. I had to see a second opinion cardiologist. I just knew this ain’t anxiety I’m feeling. There was a difference. I never had tingles on the jaw or ever felt nausea. Heart palpitations as well. I went to the ER. They released me because they didn’t see anything of stroke or heart attack. I cried and cried and told them something isn’t right. They said to see another cardiologist. So I did. He seen that my stress test wasn’t good.  I got a CT scan. He seen skemtuonh abnormal. He said I’m 1 out of every 10k people that have one arteries around my heart. The other one is tangled around the valve. So my heart has been doing more than it’s suppose to do. So he said if I don’t have surgery I will die from a heart attack. So I’m scheduled to meet the heart surgeons on Jan 4,2024. I just know I’m still feeling weird. He prescribed  me a pill to take everyday to slow down my heart rate. Any advice doctor?"

Would wake up in the middle of the night sweating with shortness of breath major exertion doing minor activities I didn't understand that I was having a heart attack. I got so weak and started throwing up and had diarrhea I couldn't control I just wanted to sleep my family rushed me to the ER they told them that if I  had went to sleep I wouldn't of made it through the night. My daughter told me later that I flat lined twice in the ER and once in the OR. I'm truly blessed to be here. God is good ya'll. Givin God all the Glory. We never know when our next breath is gonna be our last. Are you saved? If you died? Where would you spend your eternity?  It's your decision and your choice. Decide and choose wisely. Be safe and be blessed ya'll. ❤
110,Yes. It started a month ago. Only symptoms that I have is tingling in my right arm can I started shortness of breath where to the point I was going to pass out. I was bitten by a Copperhead snake 3 years ago on my left hand. I am having long-term effects from it. No use of left arm. Now the shortness of breath . Could it have something  to do with the snake bite??
111,"I have pins and needles feeling, chronic low back pain thats worse at night, cold sweats and chills, boddy pain and weakness, frequent heartburn and bloating, getting up to pee several times at night and also i get weird heart palpitations and i get short of breath when I lay back in a reclining positon. All these symtoms are intermittent. Ive been to the doctor had an mri and an ekg. The ekg said low qrs. The mri was normal. Im trying to get answers but its kinda hard to keep at it when everything comes back as ""normal"""
112,I really have difficulty in breathing and back pains i really need please
113,"I am having irregular heart beats, and shortness of breath more often or exhaustion"
114,"Sir, above all the symptoms didn't have, but now  I have shorten to breathe, I worry now because my consultant doctor refer me to take CT test, but I feel better than yesterday, please give any guidance to me"
115,"He just include all kinds of symptom as a coronavirus!? How can a man differentiate Influenza and corona virus! Have runny nose, sometimes nose congestion and wet cough."
116,"We have Omicron now.  We've had mild colds worse than this.  My son tested positive two days ago, and felt fatigue yesterday.  Today, he reports feeling ""tons better"" and is bouncing off the walls.  Remember pox parties?  Maybe we need Omicron parties.  Natural antibodies are a lot more effective than those generated by the vaccines, according to studies."
117,"I started showing omicron symptoms today and my brother has the virus, but I can't get tested until Saturday. So I'm just isolating myself, so if I come back positive on Saturday I would have already been isolated. I've gotten my first two shots and waiting to get the booster, and so far I've only had a cough. For me it's really just a mild cold. Others may be worse."
118,Everything is covid now.  Even when she has a headache she just says leave me alone I got a covid 😆
119,"Took an antigen test and tested positive. Always wear a mask when out, have two Pfizer shots and the booster. Still got it. My symptoms are mild: headache, runny nose, sore throat, deep cough and congestion. Pretty much all the symptoms of a cold. No fever. I started symptoms yesterday, and feel like I’m recovering already"
120,"My husband and I both have the Omicron variant. We developed a horrible cough, fever and severe fatigue. I am going on day 6 with the cough, fever, sweating and severe weakness. My husband on day 3 and he is coughing all night, fever, not able to sleep, no appetite, and severe weakness. We both feel very sick but don't feel it is going to take our lives."
121,"So lies lies lies . I tested positive for omicron. My husband fully vaccinated got it as well . It kicked our butts.  Fever, vomiting, cough and the worst pain on my bones I have ever felt in my life . This js all lies.  Covid will kick your ass regardless. And BTW my fills vaccinated husband was in worst shape than me and I'm the hight risk mow !"
122,"I’m currently with omicron and is a nightmare, I have chills all the time , fever , back pain all the time (like after gym pain in my whole body) no smell or almost nothing, tasting things last stronger than was supposed to taste , headache, it’s a nightmare. 
And I’m fully vaccinated."
123,"I got omicron right now, tested positive twice. It's absolutely nothing, just a mild cold and cough. Like any other viral infection."
124,"The symptoms are tiredness and fatigue. Damn, I've had omicron for the last 20 years. I thought it was called life but I guess there's a new name for it."
125,"How come nothing was closed down when tuberculosis hit an estimated 10 million incident cases and 1.5 million deaths occurred in 2018? Tuberculosis is transmitted in airborne particles called droplet nuclei that are expelled when persons with pulmonary or laryngeal TB cough, sneeze, shout, or sing. The tiny infectious particles can be carried by air currents throughout a room or building."
126,"Less than 1% of the worldwide population has died from Covid-19 and all its variants, with the majority over 65 with other health problems! So what exactly is going on? Especially with mask mandates to protect you from what? How about that coordinated looting going on it California! Nice right! Did you law abiding citizens get yours? How about illegals getting free homes, food, medical,and education! Did you get that, too? Extending mask mandates in all transit? They don’t protect you.  If the government says 3 shots don’t protect you, at $90 a pop by the way. Blundering biden continues media blind and deaf. I can’t wait for the omega virus! Quick everyone hide, also check out the dislike button counter"
127,"I got all symptoms but tests are negative with rapid kit. 
My lymph high 50.6% and Gran low 40.2.
Smell cigarettes when no one smoking around. Heavy ears irritated by sharp noise. Toe and finger tingling and burning sensation.  Lost hand and legs muscles but weight remain same. Hard stool. Dry itchy eyes. Sensitive gums. Numbness in hands. Discolored hand nail. Ankle joint pain."
128,"I was diagnosed with AIDS last year March with only 34 CD4  left with the viral load of 880k. I am so lucky I'm not having any other opportunistic infection such as pcp or any brain infection. Now, I've been undetectable with CD4 of 400+++ and living healthier. But of course when I'm not treated, I've developed skin rashes, facial , legs, arms dermatities , skin fungal infections on skins and nails, candidasis, recurring high fever, sore throat, weight loss, muscles ache, mouth ulsers, severe hair loss as well as severe dandrufts or mycoces (fungal infection on scalp) I dont have hepatitis or others STD such as gonnrhea , Syphllys. Get treated guys. It's treatable nowadays. We are living in 2023 not in 90's where the treatment is not really advance and some countries dont even have proper treatment. U can even married after reaching UVL without worrying of transmitting the virus to your partner or your babies. Its better to get hiv rather than cancer 🙄."
129,"Got positive for a week, experience cough , headache, sore throat & body weakness..then after 3 days my 3 kids got too ,10 days quarantine ,,Thanks god were ok now.."
130,"This is very informative and helping video, along with this I did BREATHING exercise, every 2-2 Hr., 3 sets of Breath in and Breath out slowly and after 1- or 2-minute pause, I did fast Breathing, breathing fast, breath out fast - 3 sets. 2 days when I did breathe exercise it cleared my nose, throat and chest from inside.

Regular breathing exercise will make raspatory system very strong. So, I have now made timetable of the day – that every morning between 10-11 am, in afternoon 1-2 pm, in evening 5-6 pm, around 3 times per day I am doing these breathing exercises.

Also, slow and fast breathing exercise provide enough oxygen to brain and help to function properly. I notice that my tiredness reduced, extra sleepiness reduce lot without any vitamin / energy tablet or protein / such juices / food. I make sure that every two hours just 5-7 time I slowly breath in thru one nose and breath out with second nose.

I also make sure that air I breath in is clear. Means ..For example : in day time under tree where people do not smoke is good quality oxygen!!

In herb, I use turmeric powder 1 spoon + carrom seed powder ½ spoon and drink with water in morning, or I use with turmeric milk or add into my curries. I learned to stay away from Sugar, 
tomatoes, catchup and fancy chips full of chemical spray. Especially when we have cold, cough – Chips, sugar, even Gatorade, oily foods are not good at all, it worsens case.

Best is Avocado, Carrot, Ginger, Onion (Not too much), Turmeric and Carrom seed and lettuce. For drink, warm look lemon water, homemade carrot juice (Carrot + water, no salt, no sugar – It cleans chest and kidney) are best.

Mix Black paper powder (about 1-2 teaspoon) + Ginger crushed (about 1-2 teaspoon) – mixed and boil in 1 cup water or milk (with trivia or stevia) and you can drink it. It will open throat.

When there is caught, we should avoid cold drinks, cold water, banana, tomatoes, fried food, chips, cookies, pizza lol!!

Sharing this because with these diets, I recovered so fast after covid and back to normal in 2 weeks!!
Wishing you good health to all."
131,"I am COVID Positive as I write this review. I started showing symptoms of COVID last Wednesday, and because I am a PSW and work in a LTC and was in Direct Contact with a Resident. I have 3 vaccines 💉 and I still contracted the virus. I have been sick for a whole week before my COVID Test came back Positive. My symptoms started manifesting as sore scratchy throat, runny nose, congestion, headache and tightness in my chest and extreme fatigue. As the week went on I got my symptoms and then realized I had no taste or smell and I was disoriented and confused and a bit dizzy and nauseous at times, but those last symptoms were the day I tested positive. The last few days have been rough, but I feel like I’m starting to get better. I pray that I am."
132,"Why is it everybody I know got better after covid. I had for say 2 weeks n half. It's been 2 months and recently it's been so bad. Chills, feverish symptoms. I feel cold weather colder than usual. Just today I we had some sun and while I was in the car I felt the sun rays so hot! How can I go outside with this hot weather nearing by. I lay down if it's a cold day I feel my arms cold. Drs can't explain what I have . One Dr did tests and my thyroid test showed a lil abnormal but he you need meds. He can't explain what I have an he says affects of covid you have weight it out. I'm tired if feeling like this. So depressed now"
133,"I got Omicron COVID and at 11/2 months later I am still having headaches & Upper back pain.. non stop everyday...now on Flonase, Tylenol 650 mg, and Doxycycline...I was Vaccinated X3..
Will see..🍀🤕"
134,"I woke up 3am vertigo and eye distortion Dec 1 ended up with tooth  pain went to ER. Said go to Eye Dr, ENT, oral surgeon.  Thevtooth was pulled last year but the dentist left in root and post which got  infected and had it removed. Then 3 weeks went by got Covid and hospitalized. Fever dry cough severe nauseous and dirrreah. Got so dehydrated and weak was released took 6 weeks to get well. Time to time I get brain fog. I am glad it's behind me. I pray for everyone 😇🙏"
135,"I got covid in Feb 22 , I'm 48 and asthmatic, it started with fever, and then high pulse, my veins bulged up which I never noticed before, and then day 2 a very bad sore throat and then day 4 I had episodes of shortness of breath, which is unlike an asthma attack, as it becomes harder to breathe I experienced seeing stars and would panic and run outside or into the kitchen,"
136,The mask will not keep you from getting the covid.it just keep you from coughing and sneezing on some one.and being put in the hospital makes it worse.will not take rhe vaccine.
137,Im STILL having symptoms after almost a month!  I've never taken so many vitamins or drank this much fluids.  The Headache is the worst.  Wish it would just go away!!
138,"I had Covid back in feb 2021 and it felt like a mere cold with cough. No other symptoms just that. My cold went away in 3 days but the cough was persistent for a month. Got Covid again 2 weeks ago and this time it was deadlier. Started out with body chills, fever, loss of appetite, loss of taste and lots of body aches. No cough until the 2nd week. The fever took about 4 days to break and everything about the 2nd Covid was a lot worst than the first. I also developed pneumonia and now I have ground glass opacities showing up in my lungs. My oxygen saturation was really low at 87-90. I tested negative for Covid on my 2nd week but I’m still having shortness of breathe and coughing. I’m worried about the ground glass which is pretty much scarring of the lungs. My oxygen saturation is around 97-99 now but it’s not a good indicator people can still have good Saturation if they were in a locked burning building. Also do not get on the investigation drug called Paxlovid from Pfizer I wasn’t sure if that thing worked but I was prescribed on it and it had a lot of nasty symptoms like I didn’t have awareness of my own body. I felt depressed and felt like I wasn’t myself. Especially when driving it felt like I had no control of anything even though I was."
139,I have very bad headache 🤕 they come and go. They are getting worst. One day lm good the need day l feeling if lm going to pass out.I have two shots and my flu shot I don’t know what’s
